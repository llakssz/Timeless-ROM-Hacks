# Timeless ROM Hacks
A small hobby project that provides patches to remove the year from the title screen of games.

## Reason
Just in case I one day hear, "Daddy, this game's too old".

## Method
Simply editing what tiles get drawn to the screen, changing as little in the ROM as possible.
Ideally not having to actually edit any graphics data, although for some games it is a necessity.
Some games (for example, Tetris DX, Super Mario Bros. Deluxe) also display the year that the game was initially released, sometimes I keep these.
It's a style thing and may change.
