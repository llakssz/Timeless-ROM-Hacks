# Timeless ROM Hacks
A small hobby project that provides patches to remove the year from the title screen of games.

## Reason
Just in case I one day hear, "Daddy, this game's too old".

## Method
Simply editing what tiles get drawn to the screen, changing as little in the ROM as possible.  
Sometimes ASM hacks are needed, changing the position where text is drawn.
Ideally not having to actually edit any graphics data, although for some games it is a necessity.

## Style
I'm not sure whether to always keep the '©' or not, next to the company name. From my view, it often looks strange to have the company name without the ©. For Trip World (screenshot below), the year is separate to 'SUNSOFT', so I remove the © and the year.  
Some games (for example, Tetris DX, Super Mario Bros. Deluxe) also display the year that the game was initially released, sometimes I keep these.  
It's a style thing and may change.
